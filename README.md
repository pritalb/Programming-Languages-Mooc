# Programming-Languages-Mooc
My Solutions to the Programming Languages course by University of Washington on coursera. The course aims to introduce the student to basic concepts of programming with an emphasis on Funtional Programming Paradigm.

The course is divided into 3 parts - Part A, Part B and Part C, with each part of the course aiming to teach how the various concepts fit together from the perspectives of 3 different programming languages - Standard ML, Racket and Ruby.
